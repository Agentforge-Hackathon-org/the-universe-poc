1. **Claude-100k “Living Database” Prompt** Claude-100k models hold the records of the ongoing narrative. They should provide outputs optimized for detail and completeness:

```
Given the recent game activities recorded as [{past_game_activities}], the NPCs' plans as[{npcs_plans}], and the world events as[{world_events}], summarize the current status of the CY_BORG game world.
```


1. **Cold Storage Retrieval Prompt** Accessing the "cold storage" database could be accomplished using a keyword-based retrieval mechanism:
```
Retrieve data from the cold storage database using the keywords: [{keywords}]. Provide a summary suitable for gaming context.
```

1. **GPT-4 Main Decision-Maker Prompt** GPT-4 will take charge of turning all the information into coherent game progress:

```
Given the player's input [{player_input}], the recent game state [{recent_game_state}], and the retrieved cold storage data [{cold_storage_data}], decide on the next course of action. Also, validate the narrative description coherence with the game mechanic resolutions if applicable.
```

1. **Narrative Generation for Jurassic-mid 7b Prompt** Jurassic-7b models are responsible for turning the non-narrative game action descriptions provided by GPT-4 into vivid narrative texts:

```
Given this non-narrative description of game actions [{game_actions}], convert it into a vivid CY_BORG narrative with suitable tone.
```

1. **Rules Reference / narrative gen for Jurassic-ultra 175b Prompt** And finally, the Jurassic-175b retrieves the relevant rules when players are attempting something:

```
Given this description of a game action being attempted by a player [{action_attempted}], identify and provide the relevant rules sections from the CY_BORG rulebook.
```


```
Given the narrative text [{narrative_text}], enhance and ensure its coherence and richness in the context of the CY_BORG game.
```

claude suggested, maybe him or gpt
```
Given the character traits and current situation of the NPC [{npc_character_traits_and_situation}], simulate a consistent dialogue or action in the context of the CY_BORG game world.
```
enhancement if needed
```
Enhance the NPC dialogue or action [{npc_dialogue_or_action}] by highlighting the NPC's character traits. [{listed traits in NPC description}]
```

GPT4 interaction decision making:

```
Given the player's input [{player_input}], and the recent game state [{recent_game_state}], decide on the next course of action or event in the game. Validate the narrative description coherence with the game mechanic resolutions if applicable.
```

World building variant:

claude:
```
Generate a detailed CY_BORG scenario given the existing game world status and recent events [{game_world_status}].
```
gpt4, mechanics?:

```
Given the scenario generated [{scenario}], craft an intricate and non-narrative game mechanism or event that the player can interact with.
```
conversion prompt:
```
Convert the non-narrative game mechanism or event generated by GPT-4 into a vivid narrative description suitable for the CY_BORG game world [{non_narrative_mechanism}].
```
enrichment:
```
python
Copy code
"""
Given the narrative text from Jurassic-mid 7b [{narrative_text}], enhance the narrative's depth, immersion, and vividness, making sure it is coherent within the context of the CY_BORG game.

```
dialogue-focused systems example:

```
# Claude-100k for NPC Dialogue and Actions npc_initial_dialogue = prompt(Claude_100k, """ Given the character traits and current situation of the NPC[{npc_character_traits_and_situation}], generate a baseline dialogue or action in the context of the CY_BORG cyberpunk game world. """) 
# GPT-4 for Dialogues and Actions Refinement npc_refined_dialogue = prompt(GPT-4, f""" Refine and expand upon the NPC dialogue or action [{npc_initial_dialogue}] generated by Claude-100k, emphasizing character consistency, game mechanics, and creativity. """) 
# Jurassic-mid 7b for Vivid Narration vivid_narrative = prompt(Jurassic_7b, f""" Given the refined dialogue or action [{npc_refined_dialogue}], convert it into a vivid and engaging narrative for the CY_BORG game world. """)
# Jurassic-ultra 175b for Narrative Enrichment fleshed_out_narrative = prompt(Jurassic_175b, f""" Enhance and ensure that the narrative extracted from the refined dialogue and game actions [{vivid_narrative}] are coherent, detailed and engaging in line with the overall tone and context of the CY_BORG game. """)
# GPT-4 for Game Mechanics Determination game_mechanics_prompt = prompt(GPT-4, f""" Given the narrative context and the actions of the NPC, determine the most suitable game mechanics or rules that govern the resolution of the actions attempted by the NPC. """)
```

updated for world state management:

claude, evolve world state:

```
Given the current state, player actions, events, and NPC states [{world_and_game_state}], generate an evolved game world state and updates to NPC dialogues, actions, and quests in the context of the CY_BORG game world.
```
GPT4: refine world, determine mechanics
```
Refine the evolved game world state and NPC dialogues, actions, and quests [{world_and_npc_updates}] Add details for maintaining consistency in the world, such as consequences of player actions and events. Determine game mechanics and rules related to player-NPC interactions, quest progress, and overall world state transitions.
```

narrative formation and enrichment, possibly jurassic

```Given the refined game world state and NPC updates [{refined_world_and_npc_updates}], convert it into a vivid narrative that encompasses the changes in the CY_BORG game world, the actions of NPCs, and quest updates.
```
