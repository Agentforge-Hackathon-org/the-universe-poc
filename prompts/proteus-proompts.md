Claude living db:
```
"Claude, update incoming[UUID]: Here's what took place since your last update....[Detailed events]. Now, generate a summary for the current world status and compile recent significant events or changes from factions, NPCs, or the environment.‚Äù
```
initial claude prompt:
```
summarize the events from the last game session leading up to the current game state. Include a detailed description of the previous rounds' actions and any significant world changes."
```

storyteller:
```
"Based on these out of character descriptions of events and actions...[OOC descriptions], craft a fitting narrative description capturing the dark, cyberpunk dystopian world of CY_BORG.‚Äù
```
alt storyteller:
```
"From these events...[Input from Claude], generate CY_BORG's fitting narrative that mystifies the cyberpunk dystopia."
```
storyteller enrichment:
```
"Examine the following story fragment: [Story from Storytelling module] Ensure consistency, depth, and vivid imagery."
```
rules checker:
```
"A player wants to perform ...[action]. What are the relevant rules or constraints from the CY_BORG rulebook?‚Äù
```
alt rules checker:
```
"Based on these attempted actions...[Player Actions], look up the relevant rules, perform the necessary die rolls, and determine the outcome."
```

rejected for incoherence, sent back with notes for improvement:
```
"Refine the narrative based on these notes...[Feedback from Jurassic-Ultra] to ensure it aligns with the CY_BORG tone and story progression."
```
GPT4, decide tools:
```
"Based on the refined narrative...[Narrative from Storytelling Correction Module], decide what game tools are needed (like background images, soundtracks, rules database checks, etc.)."
```
GPT4 - 'interplayer', resolves ambiguities and determines IC knowledge
```
"Players attempted the following actions...[Player Actions]. Resolve any ambiguities, check for character knowledge, and propose ways to reach their goals."
```
Update game state:
```
"The players made their actions and these events occurred...[Resultant events and actions]. Update the current game state and prepare for the next round."
```

suggested improvements:

Improvements:

- Consolidation: Some of the tasks assigned to different models are quite similar. Models that produce/refine narratives could be consolidated into one or two highly-tuned models for simplicity.
- Transition Buffering: The handoff between models may produce out-of-context responses. Adding a buffer that synthesizes the outputs of one model and formulates inputs for the next model could smooth transitions.
- - Sound/Image Buffering: Instead of generating new images/sounds continuously, the AI could create a 'buffer' of possible assets. It draws from the buffer according to the refined narrative for the next round.
- Explicit Error Handling: Given the diversity in tasks and assets, more robust error handling and quality checks should be integrated.
